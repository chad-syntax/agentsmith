## Architecture

Agentsmith is a platform that consists of four main components:

1. **Agentsmith Studio** - A Next.js application that provides a visual interface for creating and managing prompts
2. **Git Sync Engine** - A system that syncs prompts from the studio to a GitHub repository as files
3. **Agentsmith SDK** - A TypeScript SDK for fetching and executing prompts from the file system (and/or studio)
4. **OpenRouter** - All AI calls are made through OpenRouter to achieve maximum flexibility and cost-efficiency

## OpenRouter

We built Agentsmith to be as flexible as possible, which is why we use OpenRouter as the backbone of making LLM calls.
With OpenRouter, you get a unified API for all LLMs and access to many providers.
Allowing you to focus on on the prompts rather than the underlying infrastructure, while also giving you the flexibility to switch models and providers as needed.

## Agentsmith SDK

The Agentsmith SDK was designed to use types and files to provide intellisense in your IDE. The SDK will guard against mis-using prompts and provide a type-safe way to execute prompts.
You can make sure you are avoiding silent errors by using the correct variables and configuration when executing a prompt.

To learn more about the SDK, see the [SDK](/docs/sdk) page.

## Prompt Authoring

Authors can create prompts in the studio which will save the prompt content, variables, and configuration to the database.

To learn more about prompt authoring, see the [Prompt Authoring](/docs/prompt-authoring) page.

## Git Sync

Authors can sync the prompts to a connected GitHub repository at any time by clicking the sync button in the studio header, or on the project home page.

To learn more about git-powered handoff, see the [Git-Sync](/docs/git-sync) page.
