import { RefreshCcw } from 'lucide-react';

This guide will walk you through creating, syncing, and executing your first prompt with Agentsmith. By the end, you'll have a simple "Hello, World!" prompt running in your local development environment.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. **Agentsmith Account** – [Sign up here](https://agentsmith.dev/sign-up) if you don't have one.
2. **GitHub Account & Repository** – You'll need a GitHub account and a repository where your prompts will be stored.
3. **OpenRouter Account** – [Sign up for OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) to enable LLM access.

### 2. Connect to GitHub & OpenRouter

Before you can create and sync prompts, you need to connect your Agentsmith project to a GitHub repository.

1.  When you first enter the [Agentsmith Studio](https://agentsmith.dev/studio), you should see an onboarding popup at the bottom right corner.
2.  Click the **Install GitHub App** button and follow the instructions to authorize Agentsmith.
3.  Once the app is installed, click the **Connect a Repository** button in the popup and choose the repository where your prompts will be stored.
4.  Click the **Connect OpenRouter** button in the popup and authorize Agentsmith.

### 2. Create a Prompt in the Studio

Now, let's create a prompt in the Studio.

1.  Navigate to the **Prompts** section in the sidebar.
2.  Click **New Prompt** and give it a name, for example `Hello World`.
3.  In the prompt editor, enter the following content:

    ```jinja
    Only respond with the following text, no other responses are allowed:
    "Hello, {{ name }}!"
    ```

4.  In the **Variables** sidebar, you should see that Agentsmith has automatically detected a new variable called `name` with a type of `string`.
5.  Click **Publish** to make this version available as the `latest`.

### 3. Sync to GitHub

Now, let's get that prompt into your connected Git repository.

1.  Click the <RefreshCcw className="w-4 h-4 inline-block" /> **Sync** button in the Studio header.
2.  Agentsmith will open a pull request in your repository. This PR will contain the new prompt files.
3.  Merge the pull request.

### 4. Set Up Your Local Project

Now that your prompt files are in your repository, let's get your local environment ready to use them.

1.  Navigate to your project's directory on your local machine.
2.  Pull the latest changes from GitHub to bring down the prompt files you just synced.
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```
    You should now see the `agentsmith` directory in your project.
3.  Install the Agentsmith SDK as a dependency in your project.
    ```bash
    npm install @agentsmith-app/sdk
    ```

### 5. Execute the Prompt

Create a file named `index.ts` and add the following code. This script will initialize the SDK, fetch the prompt from your local filesystem, and execute it.

```ts
import { AgentsmithClient } from '@agentsmith-app/sdk';
import { Agency } from './agentsmith/agentsmith.types';

// Get these from your Agentsmith project page in the Studio
const sdkApiKey = process.env.AGENTSMITH_API_KEY!;
const projectId = process.env.AGENTSMITH_PROJECT_ID!;

async function main() {
  const client = new AgentsmithClient<Agency>(sdkApiKey, projectId);

  console.log("Fetching prompt 'hello-world'...");
  const helloWorldPrompt = await client.getPrompt('hello-world');

  console.log("Executing prompt with name: 'World'");
  const { content } = await helloWorldPrompt.execute({
    name: 'World',
  });

  console.log('✅ AI Response:', content);

  await client.shutdown();
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

### 6. Run it!

Set your environment variables and run the script.

```bash
export AGENTSMITH_API_KEY="sdk_..."
export AGENTSMITH_PROJECT_ID="..."

npx ts-node index.ts
```

You should see an output like this:

```
Fetching prompt 'hello-world'...
Executing prompt with name: 'World'
✅ AI Response: Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You've successfully created, synced, and executed your first prompt with Agentsmith, leveraging a type-safe, Git-based workflow.
