import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from '@/components/ui/alert';
import { InfoIcon } from 'lucide-react';

The Agentsmith SDK is the bridge between your version-controlled prompts and your application code. It's a type-safe TypeScript library designed for reliability, performance, and ease of use.

### Key Features

- **Type Safety**: The SDK automatically generates TypeScript types from your prompt definitions, ensuring you use the correct variables and preventing runtime errors.
- **Git-Native**: It's designed to read prompts directly from the files in your local repository, making your Git history the single source of truth.
- **Flexible Fetching**: While it prioritizes local files, the SDK can fall back to fetching from the Agentsmith API, ensuring your application can always get the latest prompts.
- **Detailed Observability**: Every execution is logged, providing a `logUuid` that you can use to trace and debug prompt behavior in the Studio.
