The Agentsmith SDK is a TypeScript library designed for reliability, and ease of use. It utilizes the agentsmith folder to enforce type safety and versioning when compiling and executing prompts.

### Key Features

- **Type Safety**: The SDK uses generated TypeScript types from your prompt definitions, ensuring you use the correct variables and preventing runtime errors.
- **File-Native**: It's designed to read prompts directly from the files in your local repository, limiting network requests to the cloud.
- **Flexible Fetching**: While it prioritizes local files, the SDK can fall back to fetching from the Agentsmith API, ensuring your application can always get the latest prompts.
- **DX**: The SDK provides easy shortcuts for common use-cases such as streaming or logging completions to local files.
- **Detailed Observability**: Every execution is logged, providing a `logUuid` that you can use to trace and debug prompt behavior in the Studio.
