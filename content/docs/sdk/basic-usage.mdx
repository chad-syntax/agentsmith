This guide covers the fundamental workflow for using the Agentsmith SDK: installing, initializing, fetching, and executing prompts.

### 1. Installation

First, add the SDK to your project:

```sh
npm install @agentsmith-app/sdk
```

### 2. Initialize the Client

The `AgentsmithClient` is the main entry point to the SDK. You'll need your Project ID and an SDK API Key, which you can find in your project settings in the Agentsmith Studio.

```ts
import { AgentsmithClient } from '@agentsmith-app/sdk';
// The 'Agency' type is generated for you when you sync your prompts.
import { Agency } from './agentsmith/agentsmith.types';

const client = new AgentsmithClient<Agency>(
  process.env.AGENTSMI_API_KEY!,
  process.env.AGENTSMI_PROJECT_ID!,
);
```

The `Agency` type provides full TypeScript autocompletion and type-checking for your prompts and their variables. It's generated automatically when you sync your prompts to your repository. Learn more about it in the [Agentsmith Folder](/docs/sdk/agentsmith-folder) guide.

### 3. Fetch a Prompt

You can retrieve any prompt from your project using its slug. By default, this will fetch the version tagged as `latest`.

```ts
const helloWorldPrompt = await client.getPrompt('hello-world');

// You can also fetch a specific version
const helloWorldV1 = await client.getPrompt('hello-world@1.0.0');
```

### 4. Execute a Prompt

The `.execute()` method compiles your prompt with the provided variables and sends it to the language model. The SDK enforces that you provide the correct variables defined in the Studio.

```ts
const { content, logUuid } = await helloWorldPrompt.execute({
  // Type-safe variables based on your prompt's definition
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
});

console.log('AI Response:', content);
console.log('Execution Log ID:', logUuid); // Useful for debugging in the Studio.
```

### 5. Graceful Shutdown

It's important to shut down the client when your application or script is finished. This ensures all background processes, like sending logs, complete successfully.

```ts
await client.shutdown();
```

This is especially critical in serverless functions or short-lived scripts to prevent them from hanging.
