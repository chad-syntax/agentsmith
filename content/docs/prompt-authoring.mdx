## Jinja

All prompts should follow the Jinja2 template syntax, more specifically, the [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html) syntax.

## Versioning

When first creating a prompt, it will be in DRAFT status. This means it will not be available under the "latest" tag when fetching via the SDK.
However, you can still fetch the prompt by using the `version` parameter. (e.g. `hello-world@0.0.1`)

You can publish a prompt by clicking the "Publish" button in the studio.
That version will then be the "latest" version of the prompt and available for fetching via the SDK via the slug (`hello-world`) or the latest tag (`hello-world@latest`).

You can then create a new version of the prompt by clicking the "Create New Version" button in the studio.
We make sure you follow the [semver](https://semver.org/) convention for versioning which quick access for patch, minor, and major version bumps.

### Updating a published version

Once your prompt is published, it is generally advised to create a new version for any changes you make.
However, you can also update a version that is already published by clicking the "Update Published Version" button in the studio.
You will be met with a modal asking you to confirm, as this may affect any systems you have that are using that version expecting different variables or configuration.

## Variables

You can define variables in your prompt by using the `{{ variable_name }}` syntax.
You have the option to define the type of the variable, and the default value.

### Global Variables

Under the "Globals" tab in the studio, you can define global variables that are available to all prompts.

These variables are available to all prompts, and can be used by calling `{{ global.variable_name }}` in your prompt.

### Advanced Templating

You can use the same features as nunjucks allows to use all kinds of logic in your prompts.

For example, you can use the `{% if %}` tag to conditionally include content in your prompt.

```jinja
{% if condition %}
This will be included in your prompt.
{% endif %}
```

You can also use the `{% for %}` tag to loop through a list of items.

```jinja
{% for item in list %}
{{ item }}
{% endfor %}
```

See all the available tags and filters [here](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html).

## Configuration

Each prompt comes with configuration that will be passed to OpenRouter when executed.
You can provide a list of up to three models for OpenRouter to choose at random, or specify "openrouter/auto" to let OpenRouter choose the best model for your prompt.

You can find a full list of all available models [here](https://openrouter.ai/models).

Models have a wide range of support for different features. Such as web search, tools, and more. You can view all available configuration [here](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/overview).

You can further override the configuration when you execute a prompt via the [SDK](/docs/sdk).
