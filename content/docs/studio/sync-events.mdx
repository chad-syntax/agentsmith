The Sync Events page displays a log of all events that have occurred within your project, with a focus on synchronization activities between Agentsmith and your connected GitHub repository.

This page provides a chronological list of events, showing the date, severity level (`INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`), and a descriptive name for each event. You can click on any event to view more detailed information about it.

This is useful for debugging synchronization issues or understanding the history of changes to your prompts.
