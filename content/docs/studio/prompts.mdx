From this page you can:

- See a list of all your prompts
- Click on a prompt to view its details, including all of its versions
- Create a new prompt by clicking the "Create New Prompt" button
- See the latest version of each prompt, its status (either `DRAFT` or `PUBLISHED`), and when it was last updated.
- Quickly edit the latest version of a prompt.

### Prompt Detail Page

When you click on a prompt, you'll be taken to the Prompt Detail page. This page shows you all the versions of the prompt, with the latest version expanded by default.

- **Compile to Clipboard**: Compile the prompt with variables to copy it to your clipboard.
- **New Version**: Create a new version of the prompt.
- **Edit**: Edit a specific version of the prompt.

### Creating a New Version

When you click "New Version", a modal will appear where you can give your new version a semantic version number.
