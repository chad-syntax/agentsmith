description: Getting started with the Agentsmith Studio and SDK
---

import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from '@/components/ui/alert';
import { TriangleAlert } from 'lucide-react';

## Prerequisites

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
- An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) account

## Create an Agentsmith account

Go to the [sign-up page](/sign-up) and create an account.

<Alert variant="warning">
  <TriangleAlert />
  <AlertTitle>Alpha Status</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    We are only accepting a limited number of users at this time. Creating an account will put you
    on a waitlist. If you want access now, you can join the [Alpha Club](/#pricing) for 50% off the
    first year.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

## Follow Onboarding

Once you have an account, you can access the [studio](/studio).

You will be prompted to:

1. Install the Agentsmith GitHub app
2. Connect your Agentsmith project to a GitHub repository
3. Connect your [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) Account
4. Create a new prompt
5. Test the prompt
6. Sync your prompt to your GitHub repository

This will give you a basic understanding of how to Author, Test, and Sync prompts using Agentsmith.

## After Onboarding

Once you have completed the onboarding in the studio, you can start using the SDK to compile and execute those prompts safely.

Follow the [SDK](/docs/sdk) page to continue.
