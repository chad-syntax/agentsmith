# Agentsmith tsx contributing rules for cursor AI

1. Only use named exports (`export const thing`, not `export default`)¹
2. All pages should have a single top level page component in page-components
3. All components should be in components folder either as a single file named after the component or in a subfolder named after the component¹
4. All functions should be declared in const rocket format: `const rocket = async (payload: any) => { ... }`¹
5. All props should be explicitly typed as `type ComponentProps = { ... }` and not typed inline ex: `props: { foo: any }` is bad `proms: ComponentProps` is good.
6. Only use icons from `@tabler/icons-react`
7. Only use tailwind css
8. Each component file should have at most 2 react components, any more than that and it should be split up into multiple component files/folders.
9. Any links to pages that exist under the web-studio should be prefixed with /app


¹ Exception for the Nextjs page.tsx files. They should only have one default function export.
